/**
 * @brief The KPropertyEditorItemEvent class describes request for handling a single property
 *        editor widget item's event
 *
 * Handling editor events is useful to customize behavior of the property editors.
 *
 * For example Url property editor can offer overriding the default file dialog.
 *
 * Currently supported events are:
 *  - "getOpenFileUrl" for editors of KProperty::Url. Overrides the default file dialog for files
 *    or directories. For this event own file dialog can be displayed. In this case event's result
 *    should be set to result of the file dialog. Note that even if the dialog has been canceled
 *    result should be set (to empty QUrl), otherwise the property editor will not "realize" that
 *    the dialog has been overriden and will display the built-in dialog.
 *    It is recommended to take values of the "fileMode" and "confirmOverwrites" property options
 *    into account and display file dialog in appropriate mode. See KProperty::setOption() for
 *    documentation of property options.
 *    This event provides the following parameters: "url" equal to QUrl value of the editor for use
 *    in the dialog as default value; "caption" equal to the default window's caption for
 *    the dialog, depending on variant of the dialog, e.g. "Select Existing File" if "fileMode"
 *    option is "existingfile".
 *
 * @see KPropertyEditorView::handlePropertyEditorItemEvent()

 * @since 3.2
