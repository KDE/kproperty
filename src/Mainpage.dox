/**
	\mainpage
	A generic properties framework.

 Main classes of this framework are:
  - Property, representing a single property with its own type and value
  - Set, a set of properties
  - Editor, a widget for displaying and editing properties provided by a Set object. 
    Every property has its own row displayed using EditorItem object, within Editor
    widget. 
  - Widget class provides editing feature for EditorItem objects if a user selects 
    a given item.

 %KoProperty framework also supports adding custom property types 
 and custom property editor types using Custom Property and
 CustomPropertyFactory.
  If you cannot store your value type in a QVariant, consider using composed
  properties (see FactoryManager for more information) or storing it in CustomProperty yourself with handleValue() set to true.

 Take a look at the test application, available in /koproperty/test to see how
 to use %KoProperty.
